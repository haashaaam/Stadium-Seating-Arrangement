This C++ program is a Stadium Seating Management System that helps users book seats, check seating arrangements, and view ticket holder details. Here’s a simple breakdown of its features:

Seat Booking

Users can book a seat in one of three categories: VIP, Regular, or Economy.
It collects ticket holder details like name, age, unique ID (UID), and whether they are with family.
It assigns the ticket to the first available seat in the chosen category.
View Seating Arrangements

Shows which seats are booked or empty for each category.
Seats are displayed in rows of 5 for better readability.
Check Seat Details

Users can select a specific seat number to see who booked it.
If a seat is empty, it informs the user.
If booked, it displays the ticket holder’s name, age, UID, and family status.
User-Friendly Menu

A simple menu-driven system allows users to choose options easily.
The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
This program simulates a basic stadium booking system and can be improved by adding features like cancellation, advanced seat selection, or a graphical interface.
